                                        Check out what GSL is doing in gsl_sf_legendre_Plm_e.
                                        Is there new research on working both Plm and Qlm together?

5.2.1.4   comp_ellint_1  - great      - Use the Carlson formulations.
                                        Put a good tolerance based on numeric_limits.
                                        We need underflow and overflow guards based on numeric_limits.

5.2.1.7   conf_hyperg    - great      - The stupid series seems to do pretty well.
                                        Maybe try to push the a and c and x harder.
                                        I need to do special login on nonpositive integral c.

5.2.1.8   cyl_bessel_i   - great      - Watch nu = n + 1/2, x < 2; you need very accurate gamma functions.
                                        It takes forever on MacOSX PPC on the long double!!!
                                        It gives junk for modest argument on AMD x86_64.
                                        I think we really need to compute scaled I_nu and K_nu
                                        and then multiply the exponents.

5.2.1.9   cyl_bessel_j   - great      - Watch nu = n + 1/2, x < 2; you need very accurate gamma functions.
                                        Remember to wrap that copysign!

5.2.1.10  cyl_bessel_k   - good       - Watch nu = n + 1/2, x < 2; you need very accurate gamma functions.
                                        Higher orders get bad especially near the origin.

5.2.1.11  cyl_neumann    - good       - Watch nu = n + 1/2, x < 2; you need very accurate gamma functions.
                                        Higher orders get bad especially near the origin.
                                        That gamma function needs to be horribly accurate.
                                        All our Bessels need asymptotics!

5.2.1.12  ellint_1       - great      - Use the Carlson formulations.

5.2.1.14  ellint_3       - great      - Use the Carlson formulations.
                                        This is just comp_ellint_3 with one particular argument.
                                        Put a good tolerance based on numeric_limits.
                                        We need underflow and overflow guards based on numeric_limits.

5.2.1.15  expint         - great      - negative arguments might not be so good relative to magnitude.
                                        positive arguments migh be better relative to magnitude.
                                        Look at series acceleration.
                                        We need continued fractions greater than one and before asymptopia!

5.2.1.16  hermite        - untested   - Look at scaled versions.

5.2.1.17  hyperg         - good       - There are some spots where stability seems to wobble.

5.2.1.18  laguerre       - good       - There are some stability issues at higher orders and arguments.
                                        Look for some asymptotics.

5.2.1.19  legendre       - great      - Seems rock solid unlike the associated version.

5.2.1.20  riemann_zeta   - decent     - For negative even integers I might set these to zero.

5.2.1.21  sph_bessel     - great      - This just calls the cylindrical Bessel function.

5.2.1.22  sph_legendre   - great      - Don't mess with the associated legendre function.
                                        Just do the corresponding iterations.

5.2.1.23  sph_neumann    - good       - This just calls the cylindrical Neumann function.
                                        There are issues for high orders.
