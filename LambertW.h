/** Lambert W function

  Lambert function \f$y={\rm W}(x)\f$ is defined as a solution
  to the \f$x=ye^y\f$ expression and is also known as
  "product logarithm". Since the inverse of \f$ye^y\f$ is not
  single-valued, the Lambert function has two real branches
  \f${\rm W}_0\f$ and \f${\rm W}_{-1}\f$.

  \f${\rm W}_0(x)\f$ has real values in the interval
  \f$[-1/e,\infty]\f$ and \f${\rm W}_{-1}(x)\f$ has real values
  in the interval \f$[-1/e,0]\f$.
  Accuracy is the nominal double type resolution
  (16 decimal places).

  \param branch: valid values are 0 and -1
  \param x: real-valued argument \f$\geq-1/e\f$ (range depends on
  branch)
