97. [] The plots for Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein look choppy.
       I need to jump in and work on polylog.

108. [] Look into folding polylog cases:
            __polylog_exp_pos(unsigned int __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_pos(unsigned int __s, _Tp __w)
            __polylog_exp_pos(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_neg(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_neg(int __n, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_int_pos(unsigned int __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_int_pos(unsigned int __s, _Tp __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_int_neg(int __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_int_neg(int __s, _Tp __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_real_pos(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_real_pos(_Tp __s, _Tp __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_real_neg(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_real_neg(_Tp __s, _Tp __w)

109. [] Learn how to plot even in log space and use it to pick up details in polylog
        near the origin.
        Maybe a plot_utils.h would be nice.

110. [DONE] If 2^{-s} < epsilon, zeta == 1.
        For zetam1 you should keep trying - that's why we have it.
        The polylog_asymp is slow.

120. [] check/check_dirichlet_eta.cc  -- 0 < s < 1.
        Dive into polylog.  Could use reflection.



WORKS: Test against algebraic function for Li_0.

WORKS: Test against algebraic function for Li_1.

WORKS: Test against local dilog.
	For s < -12.6 there is divergence - Li_2 is broken for real arg and presumably integral s == 2.
	The divergence gets better with increasing s.
	Fixed.

*FAIL: Non-negative integer s(0, ..., 5), real arument.
	s == 1, x == 1: log singularity error

WORKS: Negative integer (-1, ..., -5
	Original series hosed
	For negative integer s all three of my formulations involving numbers agree very well.

	The original series test as follows
	  -2 works for s > -1
	  -3 looks redeemable for x > 0
	  -4 is dead on!
	  -5 looks redeemable all over

Now start with zeta tests:

=======  N  ==========
The second pair of lines are broken:
      std::cout << mytr1::__detail::PolyLog_Exp(2.6, arg) << std::endl;
      std::cout << mytr1::__detail::PolyLog_Exp(-2.6, arg) << std::endl;
The first pair are +/-4.0, arg.

Now the second pair is OK and the first pair are dodgy! WTF!

WORKS: Test function 1 [PolyLog_Exp_pos(k,exp(i2pik)]:
	Now broken!

*FAIL: Test function 2 [PolyLog_Exp_pos(k,x)]:
	real parts diverge from 5.5 onwards.  Gets better with increasing degree.
	Looks like a breakdown.
	Fixed.

*FAIL: Test function 3 [PolyLog_Exp_neg(s<0, exp(i2pik)]:
	Dead on up until s > -8 then only first 5 or 6 digits are the same.
	This is int vs real order!  widen the eps test and see if 6 comes in!

	Better. Now the diffs are generally tiny.
	Now the diffs are on negative integers s.

WORKS: Test function 4 + 5 [PolyLog_Exp_neg(k<0, exp(i2pik]:
	Of course I replaced the series.

WORKS: Test series 6 [PolyLog_Exp_pos(s, exp(i2pix)]:
	Fixed.

WORKS: Test series 7 [PolyLog_Exp_asym(k, 100 exp(i2pix))]:

WORKS: Test series 8 [PolyLog_Exp_negative_real_part(k, x)]:


Clausen is hosed.
