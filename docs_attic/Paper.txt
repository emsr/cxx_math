NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 3

1. Introduction
When automatic computers began to appear in the 1950s various confident, and
often incorrect, predictions were made concerning the impact of these devices on
applied mathematics, science and engineering. One of these predictions was that
the need for special functions, or higher transcendental functions (as they are also
known), would disappear entirely. This was based on the observation that the main
use of these functions in those days was to approximate the solutions of classical
partial differential equations: with automatic computers it would become possible
to solve these equations by direct numerical methods. This observation is indeed
correct; nevertheless, a perusal of current computational journals in the sciences
reveals a persistent need for numerical algorithms to generate Airy functions, Bessel
functions, Coulomb wave functions, error functions and exponential integrals--to
name but a few of the classical special functions. Equally significantly, the National
Bureau of Standards' Handbook of Mathematical Functions [AS64]1 continues to
be one of the best-selling mathematical books of all time2.

The purpose of the present paper is to provide some assistance to those mathematicians, engineers, scientists, and statisticians who discover that they need to
generate numerical values of the special functions in the course of solving their
problems. "Generate" is the operative word here: we are thinking primarily of
either software or numerical approximations that can be programmed fairly easily.
Numerical tables are not covered in this survey. Furthermore, for the most part we
shall concentrate on the functions themselves; only in certain cases do we include,
for example, zeros, inverse functions or indefinite integrals. Elementary functions,
also, are excluded3. Lastly, we believe that the majority of readers would prefer
us to emphasize the more useful algorithms rather than make an attempt to be
encyclopedic: algorithms or approximations that have clearly been superseded are
omitted.

We identify three stages in the development of computational procedures for the
special functions:

(i) Derivation of relevant mathematical properties.
(ii) Development of numerical approximations and algorithms.
(iii) Construction and testing of robust software.

Included in Stage (i) are asymptotic expansions, continued fractions, difference and
differential equations, functional identities, integral representations, and Taylorseries expansions. Included in Stage (ii) are expansions in series of Chebyshev polynomials ("Chebyshev series"), minimax polynomial and rational approximations,
Pad'e approximations, numerical quadrature, and numerical solution of difference
and differential equations. In this paper the emphasis will be on Stages (ii)
and (iii), but in x2 we supply some general references for Stage (i).

In x3 we make a general survey of software libraries and packages4 that include

Technology.

3Methods for constructing and testing algorithms for generating elementary functions are surveyed in [CW80]. See also [Bai93,Bre76,Bre78a,Bre78b,Cod93a,LCY65,MY91,Smi89,Smi91,Ziv91].

recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does

collections of special functions.

In xx4 and 5 the functions are treated individually. We list software that is
already available and readily programmable numerical approximations. In x6 we
also include references to articles (or books) that may be useful for the testing or
comparison of existing software, or in the construction of new libraries. We do
not attempt what would be a herculean task of testing and comparing everything
that is available. Our philosophy in this survey has to be that of caveat emptor:
no algorithm, approximation or package that we mention should be relied upon to
produce accurate output in the absence of evidence of independent and systematic
checks.

As in the progress of other branches of numerical analysis, procedures used
to evaluate special functions are influenced heavily by the computing equipment
available at the time. In the era of desk-calculating machines the medium was
a printed table of numerical values of the wanted function, or functions, generally for equispaced values of the arguments. Nontabular values were calculated by
means of Lagrange's interpolation formula or central-difference interpolation formulas [Fox56]. In other words, local polynomial approximations were employed.
These interpolation procedures were reasonably successful for functions of a single
variable, but two-dimensional interpolation on desk-calculating machines was often
a laborious computation that was prone to error. The daunting task that faced a
(human) computer is summed up in the following quotation from the Introduction
to Karl Pearson's tables of the incomplete gamma function [Pea22]:

"As a matter of fact, supposing the use of a machine, which every modern
computer has at his command, no interpolation suggested ought to take more than
an hour's work and many much less. If the user of these tables groans under that
hour, let him compute de novo a function value, say I(6:86877; 47:1813) --including
of course \Gamma (48:1813)--to seven-figure accuracy, and when he has completed the task,
we believe his feelings towards those who have provided him with these tables will
be very sensibly modified."

With electronic computers, the number of arithmetic operations that could be
contemplated for the generation of a single function value increased considerably. In
consequence, high-degree global approximations appeared for functions of a single
variable in the form of minimax polynomial or rational approximations, or truncated
Chebyshev-series expansions; see, for example, [Cle62,HCL+68] and [Luk77b].

Chebyshev series in two dimensions also became feasible [CP66,Luk71a,Luk71b,Luk72a].
However, because of their more complicated asymptotic behavior, special functions
of two variables cannot be covered comprehensively simply by use of polynomial or
rational approximations or Chebyshev series. The situation is cloudier still when
the variables or parameters are complex, or of course when they are more than two
in number. For this reason, to achieve maximum speed, a comprehensive software
package for generating a function of two (or more) variables typically employs several different algorithms in addition to, or quite commonly in place of, polynomial
or rational approximations or Chebyshev series. The construction and testing of
such a package invariably entails prodigious effort.

Computers continue to increase in sophistication and power; in consequence
we should expect further changes in the algorithms used to generate the special

it imply that the products are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

functions. So far, the potential offered by the introduction of vector and parallel
computing machines has not been exploited to any great extent. It might well lead
to simplifications in the algorithms needed for many functions, as well as to an
increase in execution speeds. We refer again to this possibility in the concluding
section (x7).

In assembling the bibliography of this paper we have been assisted by the references collected and classified by the late Dr. L. W. Fullerton in his 1980 Bell
Laboratories report [Ful80], by access to Dr. N. M. Temme's private collection of
references, and by GAMS, the Guide to Available Mathematical Software prepared
by the National Institute of Science and Technology [BHKS90] and also available
online5.

We have searched through issues of the following journals of the past twenty-five
years for relevant references:

Applied Statistics (Appl. Statist.), Association for Computing Machinery Transactions on Mathematical Software (ACM Trans. Math. Software), BIT, Collected
Algorithms from the Association for Computing Machinery (CALGO), Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery (Comm. ACM), Computer
Physics Communications (Comput. Phys. Comm.), Computing, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics (J. Comput. Appl. Math.), Journal of Computational Physics (J. Comput. Phys.), Mathematical Reviews (Math. Rev.), Mathematics of Computation (Math. Comp.), Numerische Mathematik (Numer. Math.),
U.S.S.R. Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics (U.S.S.R. Comput. Math. and Math. Phys.)6, Zeitschrift f"ur Angewandte Mathematik und Physik
(Z. Angew. Math. Phys.), Zentralblatt f"ur Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete (Zbl.).

However, because of the sheer volume and diversity of publications on special
functions it is almost inevitable that we have overlooked some useful algorithms
and important articles. In this event we tender, in advance, our apologies to the
authors.

2. Mathematical Developments
Comprehensive compendia of mathematical properties of the special functions
are provided by the National Bureau of Standards' Handbook of Mathematical
Functions [AS64], published originally in 1964, and the 3-volume set that resulted
from the Bateman Manuscript Project [EMOT53a,EMOT53b,EMOT55], published in 1953 and 1955. These references employ the same notation for the special
functions, and we shall follow them. The NBS Handbook has been reprinted many
times by the U. S. Government Printing Office and has also been issued in whole, or
in part, by other publishers including Dover Publications, Moscow Nauka, Verlag
Harri Deutsch and Wiley-Interscience.

The forerunner of [AS64] is the book of Jahnke and Emde [JE45], published
originally in 1909, and still in print7. It continues to be useful, especially for its collection of graphs. Other useful compendia include those of Magnus, Oberhettinger
and Soni [MOS66], and (from the standpoint of hypergeometric functions) Luke

[Luk69a]. For an introductory compendium, see the recent "atlas" of Spanier and
Oldham [SO87].

Books and articles that include descriptions or surveys of general methods for
computing special functions include [Bre78b,DKK81,Gau75,HCL+68,Luk69b,Luk77b,PT84,PTVF92,Tem78,vdLT84].

Other books and articles that provide indepth coverage of pertinent topics include:

[Ask89, survey of compendia], [BG81a,BG81b, Pad'e approximations], [BH75,
asymptotic approximations], [Bre91, continued fractions, Pad'e approximations],
[BvI93, Pad'e approximations], [Cod70, polynomial and rational approximations],
[Fik68, polynomial and rational approximations], [FP68, Chebyshev polynomials],
[JT80, continued fractions], [Kar91, power series], [KG80, statistical computations], [Luk75, supplement to AS64--especially for functions of hypergeometric
type], [Mor80, power series], [Olv74, asymptotic approximations], [Riv90, Chebyshev polynomials], [Tem77, integral representations], [Tem85, asymptotic approximations], [Wim84, recurrence relations], [Won89, asymptotic approximations].

3. Packages, Libraries and Systems
This section reviews a selection of mathematical software with respect to its
support for the numerical evaluation of special functions8. In some cases only a
descriptive overview is given while in others cross references by individual function
are given in the subsequent sections x4 and x5. The cross-referenced packages,
libraries and systems are marked with a --. We used the following criteria in
assigning the -- marks:

First, a marked item must be readily accessible. Often this means it is commercial software that is purchased or leased for a fee but we also include software
that is distributed, sometimes over computer networks, by journals and research
institutions.

Second, a marked item must have a significant following in North America. (In
most cases the unmarked software is used widely elsewhere.)

Third, a marked item must be reasonably comprehensive in its coverage of special
functions.

3.1. Software Packages. In this paper software package will mean a set of subroutines, or just a single subroutine, that addresses a subfield of numerical mathematics. There are three important series of software packages that include special
functions. These packages are research contributions written in a variety of programming languages.
3.1.1. -- ACM Algorithms. These were published in the Communications of the
ACM, Volumes 3-18 (1960-75) and since then in the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS). The transition between the two journals took place with
Algorithm 493 in Volume 1, Number 2 of TOMS. Algol was required originally but
Fortran and other languages were allowed after it became clear that this condition
was too restrictive. A recent statement of the ACM Algorithms Policy appears in
[Kro91]. The policy requires ACM Algorithms to be self-contained, adequately

8General reviews of mathematical software appear regularly in the Computers and Mathematics column of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society. A useful guide to these reviews
is given in [Dev93].

NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 7
documented through comments in the code, and reasonably portable from one machine to another. A test program with sample output is also required. The policy
provides for addenda to previously published algorithms. All ACM Algorithms that
appear in TOMS are refereed. The ACM Algorithms Policy has been in effect, with
little change, since 1975.

A compendium of all ACM Algorithms is maintained in the 4-volume publication
[ACM], a useful feature of which is that all addenda to an algorithm are printed
together with the algorithm. This makes it unnecessary to gather the information
from different journal issues. A quarterly looseleaf service keeps [ACM] up-todate. The software itself is available on tape or diskette from the ACM Algorithms
Distribution Service. Order forms are printed in each issue of TOMS. Alternatively,
unofficial and possibly temporary electronic dissemination is being made available
by Netlib9 [DG87].

For indexing purposes, each ACM Algorithm is assigned a symbol from a modification of the SHARE classification system; cf. [ACM] or [ACM64]. Cumulative
indexes by SHARE classification for 1960-1980, 1981-1986 and 1987-1988 appear
in [ACM]. Algorithm 620 [Ham85,HM90b,RH84] provides a data base and Fortran program for preparing a cumulative index by SHARE classification. This
data base is updated periodically by the ACM Algorithms Distribution Service and
Netlib.
3.1.2. -- AS Algorithms. A section for statistical subroutines in Applied Statistics
was established in 1968 to "encourage the development of a published literature
on statistical computing" as the specialized needs of statistical computing were
"only partly met" by the algorithm sections of other journals [AS68]. The current
version of detailed instructions and other information for authors of AS Algorithms,
first published in 1968, can be found in [RWGH87]. All submissions adhere to
a standard format and are refereed. A test program is required for the referee's
use. Addenda to previously published algorithms are accepted and are subjected
to the same refereeing process as original algorithms. An index appears at the end
of every volume. A cumulative index of the first 251 AS Algorithms (1968-1989,
with addenda) appears in [HM90a], organized according to the GAMS scheme
[BHK91]. Corrected and improved versions of selected AS Algorithms appear in
[GH85]. Instructions for obtaining AS Algorithms on computer diskette can be
found in issues of Applied Statistics starting in 1993.
3.1.3. -- CPC Programs. The journal Computer Physics Communications was
begun in 1969 to "facilitate the exchange of physics programs and of relevant information about the use of computers in the physics community". It publishes
descriptions of CPC Programs and, in addition, general papers on the computational aspects of physics and physical chemistry. Programs and their descriptions
are refereed.

Program descriptions consist of a Program Summary (a concise description in
a standard format with keywords) and a Long Write-Up (a detailed description
of the underlying physics and algorithms). A test program is required for each
CPC Program, and each CPC Program is required to be well documented and as
portable and self-contained as possible. An index of CPC Programs is printed at
the end of every volume. Two cumulative indexes without Program Summaries

8
[CPC87,CPC90] and one with Program Summaries [CPC84] exist. A more attractive alternative is the up-to-date electronic index10 (with Program Summaries).
All these indexes are organized according to a physics-oriented classification scheme.

CPC Programs can be ordered individually or by subscription service. Ordering
instructions and an order form are printed in the back of every issue of Computer
Physics Communications.

3.2. Intermediate Libraries. Under this heading we place software that is in
some sense intermediate between software packages, which embody original research
contributions, and comprehensive libraries (x3.3 below). The libraries we consider here provide support only for mathematical functions. Furthermore, they are
largely restricted to codification of existing algorithms with all their advantages--
and limitations.
3.2.1. -- C Mathematical Function Handbook. This volume with diskette [Bak92]
is keyed to the NBS Handbook of Mathematical Functions [AS64]. Most chapters
of the NBS Handbook have a counterpart here in which brief introductory material
is followed by C code listings. A complex arithmetic package is included since C
supports only real and integer arithmetic. [Bak92] advocates the use of C because
it "is rapidly becoming the lingua franca of the computer world" and "algorithms
written in C should be very portable". He has written two other books on C
programming for technical applications.
3.2.2. -- Mathematical Function Library for Microsoft Fortran or C. These volumes [ULI90] exist to "provide users with a comprehensive set of mathematical
function routines to assist them in solving their mathematical problems on IBM
PC/XT/AT or compatibles". Each consists of a looseleaf manual with diskettes.
The documentation for each function gives usage instructions, input range, accuracy, definition of the function, algorithm, sample program and sample results. The
functions are evaluated only for real arguments. The diskettes contain a compiled
library in microprocessor assembly code for use with Microsoft compilers and the
Fortran or C source code for use with other compilers.
3.2.3. -- Methods and Programs for Mathematical Functions.

This volume with separate diskette of C programs [Mos89] presents a selection of special functions with real arguments and integer or real parameters. The
programs are designed for double precision, and tables of test results included for
every function typically show absolute or relative errors (whichever is appropriate)
of the order of 10

\Gamma 16. Where polynomial or rational approximations are used, the

expansion coefficients were generated in multiple precision using C programs that
are given in the book.

3.3. Comprehensive Libraries. When new algorithms are developed they tend
to appear first as subroutines in software packages (x3.1 above). Later they may
be assimilated into more complete software products such as intermediate libraries
(x3.2 above). Even more useful are comprehensive libraries that integrate evaluation
of special functions with other essential elements of numerical computing and offer
additional advantages such as uniform documentation, style of usage, and handling

of error conditions. Corrections and improvements, particularly in orienting the
programming toward particular computer architectures, are often made.
3.3.1. CERN Library. The European Laboratory for Particle Physics maintains a comprehensive software library [CER93], mostly in Fortran but with a few
routines in assembly language, in support of high-energy physics research. The
coverage of special functions includes the error function of real and complex argument; the Dawson and Fresnel integrals; exponential, sine, cosine and arctangent
integrals; the gamma and digamma functions of real and complex argument; incomplete gamma function; real dilogarithm and complex generalized polylogarithms;
Bessel functions of real argument and orders 0, \Sigma  14, \Sigma  13, \Sigma  12, \Sigma  23, \Sigma  34 and 1; Bessel
functions of real order and real or complex argument; Bessel functions of complex
order and argument; zeros of the Bessel functions J and Y and of their derivatives;
Coulomb wave functions of complex order, argument and parameter; complete and
incomplete elliptic integrals; Jacobi's elliptic functions (real and complex); Jacobi's
theta functions (real); Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac integrals ; Legendre and associated Legendre functions; conical functions of the first kind; Struve functions.
The library is distributed, with some restrictions, to organizations outside CERN.
3.3.2. -- IMSL Library. International Mathematical and Statistical Libraries
was incorporated in 1970 "with the intent of providing high-quality, supported
Fortran subroutine libraries in mathematics and statistics" [Air84]. In its first ten
years it produced libraries tailored to twelve different computer lines, providing an
alternative to manufacturer-supplied libraries. Currently the company offers a wide
range of products for large-scale scientific computing. At the center of its product
line is the IMSL numerical subroutine library for mathematics and statistics, which
includes an extensive coverage of real and complex special functions [IMS91]; this
reference includes a GAMS index [BHK91] and a KWIC (keyword in context)
index. The library is optimized, vectorized and parallelized where appropriate,
depending on the target computer architecture, but it contains no vector or parallel
support for special functions.

A subset of the IMSL library is offered also as a C library. This is an essential
component of a powerful interactive system (x3.4 below) which has the capability of
providing graphical and numerical computing with very large data sets. Optionally,
Maple (x3.4.3 below) can be incorporated to provide for symbolic computing.
3.3.3. -- NAG Library. An overview of the development, structure and contents
of the NAG Fortran library [NAG91] is given in [FP84]. After originating as a
cooperative project among several British computing centers in 1970 with the purpose of providing "a balanced, general-purpose numerical algorithms library," the
Numerical Algorithms Group formed a not-for-profit company in 1976 to provide
for the wider distribution of the library. The library is organized around the ACM
modification of the SHARE classification system (see x3.1.1 above) and is available
for a wide cross-section of computing systems. A KWIC (keyword in context) index and an index in the GAMS classification scheme [BHK91] are provided in the
library documentation.

Subsets of the full library are available in Ada, Algol 68, C, Fortran 90 and
Pascal. NAG is actively developing and marketing an interactive system (x3.4
below) that integrates most of the numerical power of the full NAG library with
online symbolic and graphical capabilities.
3.3.4. NSWC Library. In 1976 the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren,

10
Virginia, began development of "a [Fortran] library of general purpose subroutines
that would provide a basic computational ability in a variety of mathematical activities" [Mor93]. The design goals stressed reliability, transportability, efficiency,
ease of use, and generality. In 1993 the library contained 576 user-level subroutines,
including ones in real arithmetic for the error function and its inverse; Dawson's
integral and Fresnel integrals; exponential, sine and cosine integrals; gamma, psi
and polygamma functions; dilogarithm; incomplete gamma function and its inverse;
incomplete beta function; complete and incomplete elliptic integrals; Jacobi's and
Weierstrass' elliptic functions; Bessel functions of real argument and order. It also
contained Airy functions and complete elliptic integrals of complex argument, and
Bessel functions of complex argument and integer or complex order.
3.3.5. NUMAL Library. In 1973 the Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam, introduced this library of numerical procedures in Algol-60 with " the aim : : : to
provide Algol-60 programmers with a high-level numerical library which contains
a set of validated numerical procedures together with supporting documentation"
[Hem81]. In 1979 it contained approximately 430 subroutines, including ones for
the exponential, sine and cosine integrals; gamma function; incomplete gamma and
beta functions; error and inverse error functions; Fresnel integrals; modified and
unmodified Bessel functions of integer, half-integer or real order; Airy functions.
All subroutines are for real variables.
3.3.6. -- Numerical Recipes. This partly pedagogical series of books offers "for
each topic considered, a certain amount of general discussion, a certain amount of
analytical mathematics, a certain amount of discussion of algorithmics, and (most
important) actual implementations of these ideas in the form of working computer
routines" [PTVF92]. Besides being listed fully in the text, the computer routines
are available for purchase on diskette or under a variety of licensing arrangements,
one of which is tailored to the needs of classroom instructors. Example books
with test programs and diskettes are available also. Standard fields of numerical
computation are covered, with approximation of functions and evaluation of special
functions included. The book is published in four versions with the software coded
in Basic, C, Fortran or Pascal; another volume for Basic is [Spr91].
3.3.7. NUMPAC Library. The Nagoya University Mathematical Package is used
widely in Japan. It is a comprehensive Fortran library oriented toward Japanese
computers, including vector supercomputers. Coverage includes Airy functions;
error and inverse error functions; Dawson and Fresnel integrals; exponential, sine
and cosine integrals; complex gamma function; digamma function; dilogarithm; Riemann's zeta function; Bessel functions of integer or real order and real or complex
argument; zeros and integrals of Bessel functions; complete and incomplete elliptic
integrals; Jacobi's elliptic functions; incomplete beta and gamma functions; Legendre polynomials and associated Legendre functions; classical orthogonal polynomials; Struve functions; Abramowitz, Debye and elliptic theta functions; solutions of
the Blasius and Thomas-Fermi equations. Information can be obtained from Ichizo
Ninomiya, Chubu University, Kasugai, Aichi, 487 Japan or Yasuyo Hatano, Chukyo
University, Yagoto, Nagoya, 466 Japan.
3.3.8. PORT Library. This library [FHS78b,Fox84] is mentioned here because
it provides a framework [FHS78a] for constructing portable Fortran libraries that
has proven its utility. The framework supplies computer arithmetic parameters
via Fortran function calls. Algorithms are coded so as to be valid for a range of

NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 11
values of the arithmetic parameters; actual values are substituted at run time. The
PORT framework is used, for example, in the SLATEC library (x3.3.10 below). It
is particularly valuable in the special function routines because of their sensitivity
to precision, underflow and overflow. The PORT framework is available as ACM
Algorithm 528 (x3.1.1 above).
3.3.9. -- Scientific Desk Library. C. Abaci offers the following products: (i) the
Scientific Desk Library, a Fortran-based collection of numerical software; (ii) the
Scientific Desk Analysis System, an interactive system (x3.4 below); (iii) software
produced by others, including the ACM algorithms (x3.1.1 above). The library is
available in object code for personal computers under a variety of Fortran compilers and in Fortran source code for other computers. The Analysis System, which
is strongly oriented toward statistics, simplifies the programming burden and provides for simple graphical output. C. Abaci distributes the SPECFUN collection
[Cod93b] of Fortran programs for special functions and the ELEFUNT, INTFUNT
and CELEFUNT tests [Cod93a,CW80] for elementary functions. Inquire at C.
Abaci, Inc., P. O. Box 2626, Raleigh, NC 27602.
3.3.10. -- SLATEC Library. The acronym stands for Sandia, Los Alamos, Air
Force Weapons Laboratory Technical Exchange Committee11, formed in 1974 to
"foster the exchange of technical information among the three computing departments". In 1977 a subcommittee undertook the development of a complete, noncommercial Fortran library for numerical supercomputing [Buz84]. The primary
motivation was that the suppliers of commercial libraries regarded the supercomputing market as too small. The library subcommittee admitted subsequently five
additional U. S. Government agencies (the Lawrence Livermore, Oak Ridge and
Sandia Livermore National Laboratories, the National Energy Supercomputer Center at Lawrence Livermore, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology). SLATEC Version 1.0 appeared in 1981. Version 4.0, the third major revision
and expansion, was released in December 1992. The initial coverage of special functions coincided with FNLIB [Ful77], FUNPACK [Cod75,Cod84a] and AMOSLIB
[AD79]. Subroutines from [ADW77a,ADW77b,Amo80a,Amo83a,Amo83b,Amo86,CN81,LS81,OS83]
were added later. Available from Energy Science and Technology Center, P. O. Box
1020, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 and from Netlib (x3.1.1 above).

3.4. Interactive Systems. The software packages and libraries considered in the
preceding three sections are used in conjunction with standard programming languages. These languages are not fully interactive. A program needs to be written,
compiled and linked to libraries before it can be executed, and after the results are
examined the cycle may need to be repeated to correct errors or change parameters.
An interactive system provides a powerful set of commands which the user can enter
at the keyboard. The response to each command is displayed immediately. The
burden of programming and the compile-link-execute cycle is reduced. Programming in an interactive system serves a new purpose: to extend or customize the
command set.

A striking characteristic of interactive systems is their ability to integrate nonnumerical tasks with numerical computation. Graphical and symbolic computing
work best in an interactive environment, and one or both are combined powerfully
with numerical computing in commercially available interactive systems. The trend

11The Air Force Weapons Laboratory has been renamed the Phillips Laboratory.

12
toward increased integration of these computational components is being recognized
by recent developments of the IMSL, NAG and Scientific Desk libraries (xx3.3.2,
3.3.3 and 3.3.9 above).

A particular type of interactive system with a special capability for the numerical
evaluation of special functions is the computer algebra system, developed to provide
symbolic processing of mathematical formulas and intended, primarily, to assist
in mathematical developments. These systems contain basic mathematical information that enables them to manipulate algebraic expressions, make substitutions,
differentiate and integrate functions, solve algebraic, transcendental and differential
equations, manipulate power series, and the like. Some knowledge of mathematical
properties of special functions is built in, and more can be added by programming
extensions to the command set. Numerical approximations are to be avoided, in
keeping with the primary purpose of supporting exact mathematical developments,
but floating-point computation is provided as a secondary capability. This often
comes with a bonus when compared to the usual programming languages which
simply use the hardware computer arithmetic: the precision can be set arbitrarily.

The rationale for arbitrary precision is not entirely clear. It is clear that exact
rational arithmetic is essential in computer algebra applications. Perhaps multipleprecision floating-point, being relatively easy to implement, is considered a worthwhile additional capability. Also, evaluation of symbolic expressions may require
high precision because of numerical sensitivity. Whatever the reason, for occasional
usage of arbitrary-precision floating-point, computer algebra systems are well worth
considering.
3.4.1. HiQ (Apple Macintosh, Sun). This system [Bim93] approaches the goal of
reducing the need to write programs by making concentrated use of the graphical
user interface (the image displays and controls associated with the computer screen).
The system opens with a blank worksheet (in a window on the screen) and an array
of icons. Each icon corresponds to a particular kind of task.

For example, one icon is called the "expression evaluator". When activated by
the mouse, this icon presents a window with three areas. An algebraic expression
is entered into the input area in a conventional programming-language syntax (like
Fortran). This expression can contain numbers, symbols representing numbers, and
symbols representing built-in HiQ functions. The symbols representing numbers
are assigned numerical values in the options area as constants or finite arithmetical
sequences. Output icons are generated in the output area when the "run button"
(another icon) is "pushed" by clicking the mouse. The output icons, when activated,
display tables and graphs of the computed data.

Other tasks that can be performed by similar sequences of manipulations with
icons are numerical integration, optimization, data fitting, finding roots of polynomials and nonlinear functions of one variable, and solving nonlinear systems,
integral equations, and initial-value and boundary-value problems in ordinary differential equations.

Special functions included in HiQ are Airy functions; beta, gamma, log gamma,
psi, incomplete beta, incomplete gamma, and complementary incomplete gamma
functions; Kelvin functions; Bessel functions of integer and half-integer order;
Struve and Weber parabolic cylinder functions; hypergeometric function and series; confluent hypergeometric function and series; Riemann zeta function. Although HiQ performs complex arithmetic, most if not all the special functions are

NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 13
evaluated for real arguments only.
3.4.2. Macsyma. Macsyma [Sym92] is a computer algebra system that supports symbolic, graphical and numerical computing on personal computers, scientific workstations and mainframes. Its built-in capabilities can be extended by
programming in either Lisp or an Algol-like procedural language.

Macsyma avoids numerical approximations unless floating-point numbers are
introduced, either explicitly or as the result of special commands. Floating-point
numbers are represented internally in machine single precision, machine double
precision, or software arbitrary precision. When arbitrary precision is being used
there is a precision specifier. Operand precisions are adjusted, if necessary, to the
specified operational precision by truncating or extending with zero digits before
arithmetic operations are performed. The precision specifier can be changed at any
time.

Macsyma supports the numerical evaluation of elliptic, error, gamma, polygamma, polylogarithmic and zeta functions; Airy, Bessel and Legendre functions;
complete elliptic integrals and the exponential integral; classical orthogonal polynomials. Only the gamma, polygamma and Riemann zeta functions are computable
in arbitrary precision. Some of the other functions are restricted to single precision.
Complex arguments are allowed for the error, gamma and Bessel functions.
3.4.3. -- Maple. Maple V Release 2 [CGG+91] is a computer algebra system containing symbolic, numerical and graphical capabilities. It is available for a
wide range of computers, from personal computers and Unix workstations to vector supercomputers. The normal mode of operation is interactive. A Pascal-like
programming language, called the Maple language, is provided also. Much of the
Maple system is programmed in this language. This part, called the Maple Library,
can be viewed on the screen or printed, and serves as useful supplementary documentation or as a guide for the preparation of additional library modules. The
core of Maple, written in the C programming language, is not normally accessible
to users.

Because of its emphasis on symbolic computing, Maple avoids any evaluation
which would introduce an inexact result unless the user specifically requests it. Expressions are evaluated symbolically, with numbers rendered as rational fractions
with arbitrarily long numerators and denominators or represented as symbols. The
user can request floating-point evaluation to arbitrary precision. For mathematical
functions, Maple detects certain special values and can make appropriate substitutions. Otherwise the functions are left as symbolic representations until the user
explicitly requests their evaluation in floating-point format. These evaluations, if
they can be done at all, are to the precision specified by the user.
3.4.4. Mathcad (PC with Microsoft Windows). This system [Mat93a] is oriented
toward the engineering professions but is useful also in educational, mathematical,
scientific and statistical applications. Mathcad can be regarded as an editor and
calculator that can be used to create complete documents. These documents can
include graphics, ordinary text, and mathematical text resulting from input commands and their associated numerical or symbolic output. Commands are selected
from an extensive array of icons (similar to HiQ, x3.4.1 above) or they can be activated by appropriate keystrokes. Numerical commands support real and complex
computations with scalars, vectors and matrices; numerical differentiation and integration; solution of algebraic equations; constrained and unconstrained minimiza14
tion; Fourier transforms; statistical operations. Symbolic commands are supported
by a subset of Maple (x3.4.3 above). Coverage of special functions includes error,
gamma and polylogarithmic functions; sine, cosine and Fresnel integrals; Bessel
functions of integer order. Except for the gamma function, all arguments must be
real.
3.4.5. -- Mathematica. Mathematica [Wol91] is a computer algebra system
for symbolic, graphical and numerical computing on personal computers, scientific
workstations, and larger computers. A highly developed user interface, available
on some of this hardware, integrates Mathematica output with ordinary text for
the preparation of complete documents entirely within the Mathematica system.
A programming language, based on pattern matching, is included and can be used
for extending the capabilities of the system.

As with other computer algebra systems, Mathematica uses floating-point numbers only when requested explicitly. If numbers are introduced with no more significant figures than the precision of the machine floating-point system, and if the
machine underflow and overflow limits are not exceeded, then computations proceed in hardware floating-point arithmetic. On the other hand, numbers that are
not machine-representable are stored in a software floating-point format. Each such
number is tagged with its own precision, and computations are performed in software floating-point arithmetic. The precision of nonmachine numbers is arbitrary
but the internal representation is set to the highest justifiable precision. This is
determined by the number of significant figures in an input number and by the
precision of the operands or arguments in arithmetic operations and function evaluations. If numbers in a hardware computation underflow or overflow, then the
software arithmetic takes over automatically.
3.4.6. Matlab. This system [Mat92] uses matrix notation to provide a built-in
set of commands for standard algorithms of numerical computation. A graphics
capability is included also. Additional commands can be coded in concise procedures using Matlab notation. Symbolic computing is supported through a recently
introduced option using Maple (x3.4.3 above). Matlab runs on a broad range of
computers from personal computers and scientific workstations to vector supercomputers. One of its strengths is that it treats complex arithmetic as the natural
extension of real arithmetic: variables do not have a fixed real or complex type
as in Fortran. Nevertheless, Matlab's coverage of complex functions is limited. It
supports Bessel functions of real order and complex argument z but warns in the
online help system that the functions "may produce inaccurate results" for large
order and jzj. Built-in special functions for real arguments and parameters include
error and inverse error functions; gamma function; incomplete gamma and beta
functions; Bessel functions I, J, K and Y ; complete elliptic integrals; Jacobi's
elliptic functions.

In the references that follow an indication is made of the programming language
where applicable. Also, special note is made of references that include surveys.
Libraries and interactive systems are listed separately.

In the subsections of x4 and x5, a library or interactive system is listed only if
it employs an algorithm tailored to the restrictions of the subsection. For example,

NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 15
NAG is listed in x4.1.1 and x4.1.2 because it has separate capabilities for Airy
functions of real and complex argument. Maple is listed only in x4.1.1 because it
does not have Airy functions of complex argument. Mathematica is listed only in
x4.1.2 because it does not use a restricted algorithm for real arguments. Because
these distinctions are sometimes difficult to infer from software documentation and
even, when available, from source code, they should be regarded only as a guide,
both in x4 and x5.

NUMERICAL EVALUATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 23

6. Testing and Library Construction
In this section we list articles and books that provide general observations on
the testing of software and/or the construction of software libraries for the special
functions. For information on individual libraries see x3.

[Cod74], [Cod76], [Cod82], [Cod84b], [Cod85], [CS91], [Eva74, especially
pp. 275-301 and 357-435], [Ful77], [Gaf88], [Kuk71], [LMS73a], [LMS73b],
[Mos89], [PTVF92, example books], [Ric83], [Sch76], [SL73].

7. Future Trends
Great progress has been made in recent years in the construction of software for
generating the special functions, yet enormous gaps remain for functions having
variable parameters in addition to the argument. This is especially true when the
variables are complex. In this concluding section we offer some general suggestions
concerning future work in this area.

First, because of the sheer magnitude of the effort required, there should be a
perceived physical or other applied need before a decision is made to embark on the
construction of extensive new software for functions of two or more variables. At
present there are simply too many gaps to fill to be able to indulge in the luxury of
arbitrary selection. Moreover, great care should be exercised in the choice of actual
functions to be generated. For example, neither the Airy function Bi(z) nor the
Bessel function of the second kind Y*(z) has a useful role when the argument z is
not real; compare [Olv74, Chapters 7 and 11].

Second, coverage of a chosen region should be dictated by uniform accuracy
requirements (in an appropriate measure), not by the limitations of the methods
that happen to be used. At the very least it is frustrating for users to discover that
the precision yielded by a package varies widely, or worse still disappears altogether,
in parts of the claimed regions of coverage.

Third, the potential offered by the ongoing increase in power of computers should
be exploited with a view to reducing the number and complexity of algorithms to be
used. This includes, for example, the use of parallel or vector methods for summing
series [Kar91] or solving differential or difference equations [LO93].

Fourth--and here we are looking further into the future--the use of systems of
computer arithmetic other than floating-point should be considered. The floatingpoint system has two disadvantages which become especially annoying and timeconsuming in the construction of special-function software. One is that the associated error measure, relative precision, is quite inappropriate in the neighborhoods
of zeros. The other stems from failure due to overflow or underflow: here the usual
remedy of rescaling can be difficult to apply, owing to the extremely varied asymptotic behavior of functions of several variables. A system of computer arithmetic
that is capable of overcoming both problems in an elegant manner is the so-called
level-index system [COT89].

Lastly, any new algorithm or package should be documented fully. It should also
be subjected to exhaustive testing procedures, and these, too, need to be documented. Indeed, the proposed testing procedures should be considered at an early
stage in the planning of the main algorithms12. There are so many pitfalls in the

12For example, it is better to avoid the use of Wronskian and Casoratian relations in the main
computing package, if possible, in order to reserve these identities for consistency checks.

construction of algorithms for the special functions that the use of undocumented
or insufficiently tested packages is a risky proposition13.

A Note on the Reference Acronyms
In the references that follow, the acronyms within the identifying square brackets follow the AMS BibTeX scheme. Initial letters pertain to the author(s) or
editor(s). These are followed by two digits representing the year of publication; a
letter may also be appended to distinguish between publications in the same year,
e.g. [AB87a], [AB87b]. In the case of papers or books with more than four authors, initial letters from the names of the first three authors are used, followed by
a + sign, e.g. [ADK+84]. It is also important to note that the references
are listed according to the alphabetical order of the acronyms and not
according to the alphabetical order of the authors' names.
