1. In mathar it turns out that
(2\pi)^k B_{2k}/(2k)! - 2 is small.  It might be worth computing... carefully.
I think I just did this in __riemann_zeta_m_1_sum.
I might want a starting fit for small s?

2. __riemann_zeta_alt should be tested with vanWijnGaarden

3. Debye integrals matharr has some.
