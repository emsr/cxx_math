0. [] Use <filesystem> dammit!

1. [] In mathar it turns out that
      (2\pi)^k B_{2k}/(2k)! - 2 is small.  It might be worth computing... carefully.
      I think I just did this in __riemann_zeta_m_1_sum.
      I might want a starting fit for small s?

2. [] __riemann_zeta_alt should be tested with vanWijnGaarden

3. [] Debye integrals matharr has some.

4. [] test asymptotic Hermite polys - adjust the crossover width!

5. [] I got derivs in the Bessel asymp!
   Now I need a more principled max iteration.

6. [DONE] bincoeff can take real upper thing - infinitely many k
   Think (1 + x)^{1/2}.

7. [] Thrash long double testing!

8. [] Thrash float testing!

9. [] ibeta complement

10. [] legendre_Qlm

11. [] Test against spherical_harmonic(unsigned n, int m, T1 theta, T2 phi);
    They have spherical_harmonic_[r|i]
    Note the signed m on all of them!

12. [DONE] Owen's T function (a stat function)
  template <class T>
    calculated-result-type owens_t(T h, T a);

13. [] heuman_lambda - I've got this! - __heuman_lambda(_Tp __beta, _Tp __k)
    template <class T1, class T2>
      calculated-result-type heuman_lambda(T1 k, T2 phi);
    and __jacobi_zeta(_Tp __k, _Tp __phi)
    template <class T1, class T2, class Policy>
      calculated-result-type jacobi_zeta(T1 k, T2 phi, const Policy&);
    Done - __ellint_d(_Tp __k, _Tp __phi)
    template <class T1, class T2>
      calculated-result-type ellint_d(T1 k, T2 phi);

14. [] Expose Bernoulli numbers.

15. [] polygamma...

16. [] inverse erf and erfc.

17. [] inverse incomplete gammas
    [] We will want lgamma_scaled - the Binet function.
    [] Then tgamma_scaled - sometines called \Gamma^{*}.
    [] Then Amparo, Gil, etc have a paper...

18. [] In testcase.tcc in the big string_view header I'd like to be able to replace
#include <specfun_testcase.h>
with
#include "../testcase.h"
for [] TR1 test generation...

19. [] Tabulate riemann_zeta for integer arguments - various sums can use this.

20. [DONE] Loof at test_cyl_hankel - we got issues! vu=1, z=0.01 Y bombs on steeds algorithm!
       OK! Steeds algorithm fails for cyl_neumann for exatly nu=1 and no thoer. WTF!
       nearbyint(nu + .5) -> nearbyint(nu).  mu = nu - n was -1.

21. [] Finish experfc = exp(x*x)*erfc(x) (and maybe even sqrt(pi)*x*exp(x*x)*erfc(x))

22. [] ../LambertW has a very good static polynomial I think - with static Horner.

23. [DONE] We have both psi *and* digamma!  Pick one!

24. [DONE] polynomial.h needs outline polynomial.tcc

25. [] Why did dilog lose the x=0 test?
       It is because the answer dilog(0) == 0.  So the fractional error blows up even wgen the answer is spot on.
       But it doesn't look like such a point would be skipped though.
       We need a way of trapping this...

26. [DONE] __log_gamma was a very sobering exercise in trig accuracy.
       The error in the location of the zeros of, say,
       std::sin(x) grow linearly with argument!
       I had to test epsilon * |x| for zero to place poles!
       The world really needs reperiodized trig functions!

27. [] Should I do the /_GLIBCXX_END_NAMESPACE_VERSION thing for __gnu_cxx?

28. [DONE] ibeta looks like it might have problems for large a, b near end points.
           Check test_beta_inc.

29. [DONE] Lose __eps, __min, __max, __inf, __NaN from math_const in favor of numeric_limits.h

30. []
