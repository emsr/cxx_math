The first significant library upgrade on the road to C++2011, T\+R1, included a set of 23 mathematical functions that significntly extended the standard trancendental functions inherited from C and declared in $<$cmath$>$. \href{http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.pdf}{\tt http\+://www.\+open-\/std.\+org/\+J\+T\+C1/\+S\+C22/\+W\+G21/docs/papers/2005/n1836.\+pdf} Although most components from T\+R1 were adopted for C++11 these math function were left behind out of concern for implementability. The math functions were published as a separate international standard. \href{http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2010/n3060.pdf}{\tt http\+://www.\+open-\/std.\+org/\+J\+T\+C1/\+S\+C22/\+W\+G21/docs/papers/2010/n3060.\+pdf}\hypertarget{index_Implementation}{}\section{Implementation}\label{index_Implementation}
