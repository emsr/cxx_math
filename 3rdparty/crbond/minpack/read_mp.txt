======================================

These files include a port of a subset of the Fortran MINPACK package to C.
MINPACK provides several optional paths for solving nonlinear least squares
problems, depending on the availability of a user provided Jacobian matrix.
The most general path involves internal calculation of an estimate of the
Jacobian using finite differences, and that is the path included here.

Complete documentation for MINPACK can be found in...

FILES
=====

The files are distributed among several directories for convenience in
identification. For application development a totally different directory
structure would be better, and you should feel free to relocate files as
needed.

SOURCE FILES

The source and header files are in the directory: SRC.

TEST FILES

A few test files are in the directory: TEST. Batch files for the Borland
BCC32 compiler are provided to show the dependencies. These files assume
that all source files are in the default directory. You can ignore the
batch files if you have compiled the source files into a suitable
directory. (Recommended.)

CAVEATS
=======

The author makes no warranty about the correctness of any translation. This
is just as well, because there is no guarantee that the original codes were
error free in the first place. Every effort has been made to assure that the
programs are functional and that they perform as expected.
