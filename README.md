# TR29124 Mathematical Special Functions in C++

This repository contains work toward
[IS 29124 - Extensions to the C++ Library to Support Mathematical Special Functions]
(http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2010/n3060.pdf)
hence the awkward name.

This library also contains work towards follow-up published proposals
for new special functions:
[A proposal to add special mathematical functions according to
the ISO/IEC 80000-2:2009 standard, Vincent Reverdy]
(http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2013/n3494.pdf)

[A Proposal to add Mathematical Functions for Statistics
to the C++ Standard Library, Paul A Bristow]
(http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2004/n1668.pdf)

[A proposal to add sincos to the standard library, Paul Dreik]
(http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0081r0.pdf)

This work is targeted towards (and licensed for) libstdc++ but I hope that
it is generally useful and amusing.

The functions in IS 29124 have been accepted into C++17.
See Section 26.9.5 Mathematical special functions [sf.cmath] in a recent draft.

In addition to the special functions in C++17, this library adds several extensions:
* Hypergeometric functions
* Carlson elliptic functions
* Jacobi elliptic functions, amplitude, and nome
* Polylogarithm functions
* Hankel functions
* Statistical functions
* Quadrature rules
* Polynomial classes and solvers
* ...

I strive for type genericity.  I want C++ numerics to follow
the containers + algorithms by having numeriic algorithms that will
work for any type for which numeric_limits, and the basic math functions
are available.  These functions have been tested with float, double, long double,
and __float128.  Some have been tested with mpreal and efforts are underway to
allow full multiprecision usage.

I generally strive towards accuracy first and speed second.
