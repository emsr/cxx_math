This is to study the Gil, Segura, Temme harmonics: toroidal and spheroidal.

The orthogonal polynomial lab was already crowded and these aren't really polynomials.
(The associated Lagendre and Laguerre aren't either but... yeah.)

The Fortran code is over in
  ../../3rdparty/Gil_Segura_Temme/toroidal_harmonic_2

The theory is covered in:
  Numerical Methods for Special Functions,
  Amparo Gil, Javier Segura, Nico M. Temme,
  SIAM, 2007

The Fortan code for the ellipsoidal harmonics is over in:
  ../../3rdparty/Gil_Segura_Temme/spheroidal_harmonic
