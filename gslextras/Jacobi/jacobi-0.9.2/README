libjacobi version 0.9 (2006-07-13)

A library to compute Jacobi polynomials and Gauss-Jacobi quadrature related stuff.
It can be used to integrate, derivate and interpolate functions.

Just include jacobi.h in your program and link the libjacobi.a library. It requires the GNU Scientific library (GSL).


Documentation: It has doxygen generated documentation. It still needs som
improvement but it is usable. This is a beta release. I am developing this
library to become a GNU Scientific Library package.
