C++ Special Math Functions
</head>
<body>
<p>
See the current <a href="html/index.html">API documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The portion of math special functions that has been accepted into C++17
are also documented at the usual C++ sites:
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/special_math">cppreference</a>
and
<a href="http://docs.w3cub.com/cpp/numeric/special_math/">W3cub</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://root.cern.ch/root/html606/group__SpecFunc.html">ROOT</a>
library from CERN has implementations of these funtions and a few others.
</p>

<p>
The Boost library has these
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/libs/math/doc/html/special.html">special functions</a>
and many other mathematical tools as well.
</p>

<p>
An HTML extraction of the relavant portion of the C++ standard is available from
<a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/sf.cmath">Tim Song</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to <a href="mailto:3dw4rd@verizon.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hear from you</a>
about all topics C++ and/or maths.
